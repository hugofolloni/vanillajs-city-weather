# TheWeather
A website that shows the weather from your current location, accessing your geolocation by the browser. But, if you want, you can also request the data from other places on the world, display too the localtime there. Also, the background changes if is day or night on the place. For this project, I used 3 APIs, besides cors-anywhere.
